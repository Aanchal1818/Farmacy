                        <p>Crop: Wheat</p>
                        <p>Disease: Cedar Wheat Rust</p>
                        <p>Cause and Prevention: Break the links in the triangle at any point and disease will not
                            occur. For example, if you plant the susceptible crabapple Malus â€˜Radiant' in an area where
                            the apple scab fungus Venturia inaequalis is abundant, and spring is very moist, all three
                            components of the disease triangle are in place, and the tree will likely develop
                            significant scab disease. But if you plant a disease-resistant cultivar such as Malus
                            'Prairiefire', you don't provide a susceptible host and can avoid infection.

                            Another approach is to exclude pathogens. Removing blighted potato tubers from the garden at
                            the end of the season limits the amount of fungal inoculum (pathogen tissue responsible for
                            causing infection) available for the next season. Cleaning up black-spotted rose leaves in
                            the fall reduces the amount of black spot fungal inoculum. Or you can adopt cultural
                            practices that make the environment less conducive to infection. If you avoid overhead
                            watering, for example, you discourage infection by foliar pathogens that thrive on damp
                            leaves.</p>
